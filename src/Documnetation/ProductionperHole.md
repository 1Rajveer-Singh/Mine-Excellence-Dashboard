### Deep Explanation of the `ProductionPerHole` React Component

This document provides an in-depth analysis of the `ProductionPerHole` component, a specialized dashboard for visualizing and analyzing the efficiency of mining blast operations.

#### 1. Core Purpose and Functionality

The `ProductionPerHole` dashboard is an analytics tool designed to monitor two key performance indicators of blast efficiency: **Production per Hole** and **Total Holes Blasted**. It renders this data on an interactive, dual-axis line chart, which also includes a calculated **trendline** for production, allowing users to assess performance and identify trends over various time scales.

**Key Features:**
*   **Dual-Axis Line Chart:** Uses the `recharts` library to plot "Production per Hole" and "Total Holes Blasted" on two independent Y-axes, enabling clear comparison of productivity and effort.
*   **Trendline Analysis:** Automatically calculates and displays a linear regression trendline for the "Production per Hole" data, helping to visualize the overall performance trajectory.
*   **Advanced Time Filtering:** Users can switch between "Daily," "Monthly," and "Yearly" views, with context-aware controls for filtering by date range, a specific month and year, or a range of years.
*   **Measurement Toggling:** Allows users to show or hide the lines for "Production per Hole" and "Total Holes Blasted" independently to focus their analysis.
*   **Statistical Summaries:** Displays key statistics (average production, total holes, total blasts, total cost) in clear, concise summary cards.
*   **Robust Export Engine:** A powerful export feature allows users to download the chart visualization and its underlying data in multiple formats (PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG, CSV).

#### 2. Component Architecture and Props

The component is a functional React component built with Hooks (`useState`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `useEffect`) for state management, performance optimization, and direct DOM interaction.

**Props:**
*   `filteredData` (Array): The primary data source. It's an array of objects, where each object represents a single blast event. The component expects the following **real field names**:
    *   `blastdate` (String): The date of the blast in "DD-MM-YYYY" format.
    *   `total_exp_cost` (Number): The total cost of the blast.
    *   `production_ton_therotical` (Number): The theoretical production tonnage from the blast.
    *   `hole_blasted` (Number): The number of holes blasted in the event.
*   `DarkMode` (Boolean): A flag to control the theme. The component's internal logic is `const isDarkMode = !DarkMode`.

#### 3. Data Processing and Formulas (`useMemo` Hook)

The component's core data transformation logic is encapsulated within a `useMemo` hook for `processedData`. This is a critical optimization that ensures data is only re-calculated when a dependency (like `timeMode` or the date filters) changes.

**Step 1: Data Validation**
The first step filters the raw data. A record is considered valid if it has a valid date, a cost, and the necessary fields to calculate production per hole. The core calculation requires:
```
(record.production_ton_therotical > 0) AND (record.hole_blasted > 0)
```

**Step 2: Time-Based Filtering**
The validated records are then filtered based on the selected `timeMode` and its corresponding date controls.

**Step 3: Data Calculation and Aggregation**
The final data set is created based on the `timeMode`, with specific formulas for each view.

*   **Core Formula for Production per Hole:**
    This is the central calculation performed for each valid record.
    ```
    production_per_hole = record.production_ton_therotical / record.hole_blasted
    ```

*   **If `timeMode` is 'Daily' or 'Monthly'**:
    The data is **not aggregated**. Each individual blast record is represented as a data point on the chart, with its `production_per_hole` calculated using the formula above.

*   **If `timeMode` is 'Yearly'**:
    The data **is aggregated**. All records for a given year are grouped together to produce a single data point representing the period's average or total.
    *   **Formula for Average Production per Hole (for the year):**
        ```
        Avg(Production per Hole) = (Σ calculated_production_per_hole) / N_valid
        ```
        *(Where `N_valid` is the count of records with a valid production per hole value in that year.)*
    *   **Formula for Total Holes Blasted (for the year):**
        ```
        Total(Holes Blasted) = Σ record.hole_blasted
        ```

**Step 4: Trendline Calculation**
After the main data is processed, a linear regression is performed on the `production_per_hole` data to calculate a trendline. This involves:
1.  Assigning an index (`x`) to each data point.
2.  Using the `production_per_hole` value as `y`.
3.  Calculating the sums: `Σx`, `Σy`, `Σxy`, `Σx²`.
4.  Using these sums to solve for the slope (`m`) and y-intercept (`b`) of the line `y = mx + b`.
5.  A new `trendline` property is added to each data point with its calculated value on the trendline.

#### 4. Summary Statistics (`summaryStats`)

A separate `useMemo` hook calculates high-level statistics based on the `processedData`.

*   `totalCost`: The sum of the `total_exp_cost` field for all records in the current view.
*   `avgProductionPerHole`: The average of all valid `production_per_hole` values in the current view.
*   `totalHolesBlasted`: The sum of the `hole_blasted` field for all records.
*   `totalBlasts`: The total count of records in the current view.

#### 5. Export Functionality (`handleExport` and `handleExportSimple`)

The component includes two export functions, likely for improved compatibility across different browser environments.

*   **Primary Method (`handleExport`):** Uses `html2canvas` to capture a high-resolution image of the chart container, including styles and layout. This is excellent for visual formats like PNG, JPEG, and PDF.
*   **Simple/Fallback Method (`handleExportSimple`):** Provides a more direct export path. For CSV, it manually constructs the file. For image formats, it extracts the raw SVG from the chart, converts it to a canvas, and then exports it. This can be more reliable if `html2canvas` encounters complex CSS.
*   **Formats:** Both methods support PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG, and CSV.

#### 6. Rendering and UI (JSX)

*   **Header & Controls:** Provides the UI for changing `timeMode`, date ranges, and toggling the visibility of the "Production per Hole" and "Total Holes Blasted" lines.
*   **Main Chart:** The `recharts` `<LineChart>` is the centerpiece.
    *   **Dual Y-Axes:** It uses two `<YAxis>` components, each with a unique `yAxisId` (`"left"` and `"right"`), to plot the two different data series with their own scales.
    *   **Lines:** Three `<Line>` components are rendered conditionally: one for `production_per_hole`, one for `total_holes_blasted`, and a dashed line for the calculated `trendline`.
*   **Summary Cards:** Four cards display the key calculated statistics.
