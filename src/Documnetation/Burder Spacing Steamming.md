### Deep Explanation of the `BlastMeasurementAnalytics` React Component

This document provides an in-depth analysis of the `BlastMeasurementAnalytics` component, a comprehensive tool for visualizing and analyzing key blast design measurements.

#### 1. Core Purpose and Functionality

The `BlastMeasurementAnalytics` component is a specialized data visualization dashboard designed to analyze fundamental blast parameters: **Burden**, **Spacing**, and **Stemming Length**. It renders this data on an interactive bar chart, allowing users to compare these measurements across different time scales and export the findings.

**Key Features:**
*   **Interactive Bar Chart:** Uses the `recharts` library to display a responsive bar chart comparing the three key measurements.
*   **Multiple Time Views:** Users can switch between "Daily," "Monthly," and "Yearly" views, which changes how the data is filtered and aggregated.
*   **Dynamic Filtering:** Provides context-aware controls to filter the data by date range, a specific month and year, or a range of years.
*   **Measurement Toggling:** Allows users to show or hide the bars for Burden, Spacing, or Stemming Length to focus their analysis.
*   **Statistical Summaries:** Displays key statistics (total and percentage contribution) for each measurement in clear, concise summary cards.
*   **Robust Export Engine:** A powerful export feature allows users to download the chart and data in multiple formats (PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG, CSV), complete with titles and metadata.
*   **Modern UI:** Built with Tailwind CSS for a responsive, clean, and modern user interface that supports both light and dark modes.

#### 2. Component Architecture and Props

The component is a functional React component built with Hooks (`useState`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `useEffect`) for state management, performance optimization, and DOM interaction.

**Props:**
*   `filteredData` (Array): The primary data source for the component. It's an array of objects, where each object represents a single blast event. The component expects the following **real field names**:
    *   `blastdate` (String): The date of the blast ("DD-MM-YYYY").
    *   `burden` (Number): The burden measurement.
    *   `spacing` (Number): The spacing measurement.
    *   `sremming_length` (Number): The stemming length measurement. *(Note: This appears to be a typo in the source code, but it is the actual field name the component is programmed to use.)*
*   `DarkMode` (Boolean): A flag to control the theme. The component's internal logic is `const isDark = !DarkMode`.

#### 3. Data Processing and Formulas (`useMemo` Hook)

The component's core data transformation logic is encapsulated within a `useMemo` hook for `processedData`. This is a critical optimization that ensures data is only re-calculated when a dependency (like `timeMode` or the date filters) changes.

**Step 1: Data Validation**
The first step filters the raw `filteredData` to include only valid records. A record is considered valid if the following expression is true:
```
(record.burden IS NOT NULL) AND (record.spacing IS NOT NULL) AND (record.sremming_length IS NOT NULL) AND (record.blastdate IS NOT NULL)
```

**Step 2: Time-Based Filtering**
The validated records are then filtered based on the selected `timeMode` and its corresponding date controls.

**Step 3: Data Calculation and Aggregation**
The final data set is created based on the `timeMode`.

*   **If `timeMode` is 'Yearly'**:
    The data **is aggregated**. All records for a given year are grouped together to produce a single data point representing the annual average for each measurement.
    *   **Formula for Average Burden (for a year):**
        ```
        Avg(Burden) = (Σ record.burden) / N
        ```
    *   **Formula for Average Spacing (for a year):**
        ```
        Avg(Spacing) = (Σ record.spacing) / N
        ```
    *   **Formula for Average Stemming Length (for a year):**
        ```
        Avg(Stemming Length) = (Σ record.sremming_length) / N
        ```
        *(Where `N` is the number of records in that year's group.)*

*   **If `timeMode` is 'Daily' or 'Monthly'**:
    The data is **not aggregated**. Each individual blast record is represented as a data point on the chart.
    *   **Formula for Burden:**
        ```
        ChartValue(Burden) = record.burden
        ```
    *   **Formula for Spacing:**
        ```
        ChartValue(Spacing) = record.spacing
        ```
    *   **Formula for Stemming Length:**
        ```
        ChartValue(Stemming Length) = record.sremming_length
        ```

#### 4. Summary Calculations (`totals` and `summaryCards`)

A separate `useMemo` hook calculates high-level statistics based on the `processedData`.

*   First, it calculates the **sum** of each measurement across all records in the current view.
    *   `Total(Burden) = Σ record.burden`
    *   `Total(Spacing) = Σ record.spacing`
    *   `Total(Stemming Length) = Σ record.stemming_length`
*   Next, it calculates a grand total for percentage calculations.
    *   `TotalMeasurement = Total(Burden) + Total(Spacing) + Total(Stemming Length)`
*   Finally, the percentage contribution of each measurement is calculated for the summary cards.
    *   **Formula for Percentage Share (for each category):**
        ```
        % Share(category) = ( Total(category) / TotalMeasurement ) * 100
        ```

#### 5. Export Functionality (`useCallback` and `useRef`)

The export functionality is robust, using `useRef` to get a direct reference to the chart's DOM element for high-quality captures.

*   **PNG/JPEG/PDF Export:** Uses the `html2canvas` library to capture a high-resolution image of the chart container. For PDF, it then uses `jspdf` to place this image into a landscape A4 document, adding titles, the date range, and key statistics as text. This creates a comprehensive, report-ready document. The code includes fallback mechanisms in case the primary canvas rendering fails.
*   **SVG Export:** Grabs the chart's raw SVG element from the DOM, clones it, adds metadata and a background, and creates a downloadable `Blob` for a scalable, high-quality vector image.
*   **CSV Export:** Manually constructs a CSV string from the `processedData`, with headers corresponding to the real field names.

#### 6. Rendering and UI (JSX)

*   **Header:** Contains the dashboard title and the export dropdown menu. The export button is disabled during the export process.
*   **Filter Panel:** A well-organized section with controls for `timeMode`, date inputs, and buttons to toggle the visibility of each measurement on the chart.
*   **Summary Cards:** Four cards that display the calculated totals and percentage share for each measurement.
*   **Main Chart:** The `recharts` `<BarChart>` is the centerpiece.
    *   Each `<Bar>` component is mapped to a real field name via the `dataKey` prop (e.g., `<Bar dataKey="burden" ... />`).
    *   The bars are conditionally rendered based on the `activeBars` state, allowing the user to show or hide them.
    *   A custom tooltip provides a clear breakdown of values on hover.
