### Deep Explanation of the Production per Meter Analytics Component

This document provides an in-depth analysis of the `ProductionPerMeter` component, a specialized dashboard for visualizing and analyzing the efficiency of mining blast operations based on drilling meterage.

*(Note: The component is named `ProductionPerHole` in the code, but all its calculations, labels, and functionality are centered around "Production per Meter" and "Total Meterage Blasted". This description reflects its actual function.)*

#### 1. Core Purpose and Functionality

The `ProductionPerMeter` dashboard is an analytics tool designed to monitor two key performance indicators of blast efficiency: **Production per Meter** (tons produced per meter drilled) and **Total Meterage Blasted**. It renders this data on an interactive, dual-axis line chart and includes a calculated **trendline** for production efficiency, allowing users to assess performance and identify trends over various time scales.

**Key Features:**
*   **Dual-Axis Line Chart:** Uses the `recharts` library to plot "Production per Meter" and "Total Meterage Blasted" on two independent Y-axes, enabling a clear comparison of drilling efficiency against the total drilling effort.
*   **Trendline Analysis:** Automatically calculates and displays a linear regression trendline for the "Production per Meter" data, helping to visualize the overall performance trajectory and identify long-term patterns.
*   **Advanced Time Filtering:** Users can switch between "Daily," "Monthly," and "Yearly" views, with context-aware controls for filtering the data by a specific date range, a selected month and year, or a range of years.
*   **Measurement Toggling:** Allows users to show or hide the lines for "Production per Meter" and "Total Meterage Blasted" independently to focus their analysis.
*   **Statistical Summaries:** Displays key statistics (average production per meter, total meterage, total blasts, and total cost) in clear, concise summary cards.
*   **Robust Export Engine:** A powerful export feature with primary and fallback methods (`handleExport` and `handleExportSimple`) allows users to download the chart and its underlying data in multiple formats (PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG, CSV).

#### 2. Component Architecture and Props

The component is a functional React component built with Hooks (`useState`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `useEffect`) for state management, performance optimization, and direct DOM interaction.

**Props:**
*   `filteredData` (Array): The primary data source. It's an array of objects, where each object represents a single blast event. The component expects the following **real field names**:
    *   `blastdate` (String): The date of the blast in "DD-MM-YYYY" format.
    *   `total_exp_cost` (Number): The total cost of the blast.
    *   `production_ton_therotical` (Number): The theoretical production tonnage from the blast.
    *   `total_drill` (Number): The total meterage drilled for the blast.
*   `DarkMode` (Boolean): A flag to control the theme.

#### 3. Data Processing and Formulas (`useMemo` Hook)

The component's core data transformation logic is encapsulated within a `useMemo` hook for `processedData`. This is a critical optimization that ensures data is only re-calculated when a dependency (like `timeMode` or the date filters) changes.

**Step 1: Data Validation**
The first step filters the raw data. A record is considered valid if it has a valid date, a cost, and the necessary fields to calculate production per meter. The core calculation requires:
```
(record.production_ton_therotical > 0) AND (record.total_drill > 0)
```

**Step 2: Time-Based Filtering**
The validated records are then filtered based on the selected `timeMode` and its corresponding date controls.

**Step 3: Data Calculation and Aggregation**
The final data set is created based on the `timeMode`, with specific formulas for each view.

*   **Core Formula for Production per Meter:**
    This is the central calculation performed for each valid record.
    ```
    production_per_meter = record.production_ton_therotical / record.total_drill
    ```

*   **If `timeMode` is 'Daily' or 'Monthly'**:
    The data is **not aggregated**. Each individual blast record is represented as a data point on the chart, with its `production_per_meter` calculated using the formula above.

*   **If `timeMode` is 'Yearly'**:
    The data **is aggregated**. All records for a given year are grouped together to produce a single data point representing the period's average or total.
    *   **Formula for Average Production per Meter (for the year):**
        ```
        Avg(Production per Meter) = (Σ calculated_production_per_meter) / N_valid
        ```
        *(Where `N_valid` is the count of records with a valid production per meter value in that year.)*
    *   **Formula for Total Meterage Blasted (for the year):**
        ```
        Total(Meterage Blasted) = Σ record.total_drill
        ```

**Step 4: Trendline Calculation**
After the main data is processed, a linear regression is performed on the `production_per_meter` data to calculate a trendline. This involves:
1.  Assigning an index (`x`) to each data point.
2.  Using the `production_per_meter` value as `y`.
3.  Calculating the sums: `Σx`, `Σy`, `Σxy`, `Σx²`.
4.  Using these sums to solve for the slope (`m`) and y-intercept (`b`) of the line `y = mx + b`.
5.  A new `trendline` property is added to each data point with its calculated value on the trendline.

#### 4. Summary Statistics (`summaryStats`)

A separate `useMemo` hook calculates high-level statistics based on the `processedData`.

*   `totalCost`: The sum of the `total_exp_cost` field for all records in the current view.
*   `avgProductionPerMeter`: The average of all valid `production_per_meter` values in the current view.
*   `totalMeterageBlasted`: The sum of the `total_drill` field for all records.
*   `totalBlasts`: The total count of records in the current view.

#### 5. Export Functionality (`handleExport` and `handleExportSimple`)

The component includes two export functions to ensure robustness across different browser environments.

*   **Primary Method (`handleExport`):** Uses `html2canvas` to capture a high-resolution, styled image of the chart container, which is ideal for visually rich formats like PNG, JPEG, and PDF.
*   **Simple/Fallback Method (`handleExportSimple`):** Provides a more direct export path. For CSV, it manually constructs the file. For image formats, it extracts the raw SVG from the chart, converts it to a canvas, and then exports it. This is a reliable fallback if `html2canvas` encounters complex CSS.
*   **Formats:** Both methods support PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG, and CSV.

#### 6. Rendering and UI (JSX)

*   **Header & Controls:** Provides the UI for changing `timeMode`, date ranges, and toggling the visibility of the "Production per Meter" and "Total Meterage Blasted" lines.
*   **Main Chart:** The `recharts` `<LineChart>` is the centerpiece.
    *   **Dual Y-Axes:** It uses two `<YAxis>` components, each with a unique `yAxisId` (`"left"` and `"right"`), to plot the two different data series with their own scales.
    *   **Lines:** Three `<Line>` components are rendered conditionally: one for `production_per_meter`, one for `total_meterage_blasted`, and a dashed line for the calculated `trendline`.
*   **Summary Cards:** Four cards display the key calculated statistics.
