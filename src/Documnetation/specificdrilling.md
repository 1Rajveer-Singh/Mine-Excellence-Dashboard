### Deep Explanation of the `SpecificDrilling` Analytics Component

This document provides an in-depth analysis of the `SpecificDrilling` component, a specialized dashboard for visualizing and analyzing the efficiency of drilling operations in mining.

#### 1. Core Purpose and Functionality

The `SpecificDrilling` dashboard is an analytics tool designed to monitor a critical blast efficiency metric: **Specific Drilling**. This value represents the amount of drilling (in meters) required to break a unit volume of rock (in cubic meters), effectively measuring drilling intensity (m/m³). The component renders this data on an interactive line chart and includes a calculated **trendline**, allowing users to assess performance and identify trends over various time scales.

**Key Features:**
*   **Dynamic Calculation:** The component's primary feature is its ability to calculate Specific Drilling on-the-fly using a core formula, making it adaptable to various data sources.
*   **Interactive Line Chart:** Uses the `recharts` library to display Specific Drilling trends over time.
*   **Trendline Analysis:** Automatically calculates and displays a linear regression trendline for the Specific Drilling data, helping to visualize the overall performance trajectory.
*   **Advanced Time Filtering:** Users can switch between "Daily," "Monthly," and "Yearly" views, with context-aware controls for filtering the data.
*   **Statistical Summaries:** Displays key statistics (average specific drilling, total drilling meterage, total theoretical volume, and total cost) in clear, concise summary cards.
*   **Robust Export Engine:** A powerful export feature with primary and fallback methods (`handleExport` and `handleExportSimple`) allows users to download the chart and its underlying data in multiple formats (PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG, CSV).

#### 2. Component Architecture and Props

The component is a functional React component built with Hooks (`useState`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `useEffect`).

**Props:**
*   `filteredData` (Array): The primary data source. It's an array of objects, where each object represents a single blast event. The component expects the following **real field names** for its calculations:
    *   `blastdate` (String): The date of the blast in "DD-MM-YYYY" format.
    *   `total_exp_cost` (Number): The total cost of the blast.
    *   **For Specific Drilling Calculation:**
        *   **Numerator (Total Drilling Meterage):** Checks for `item.total_drill_meterage`, `item.total_drilling`, `item.total_drill`, or `item.drilling_meterage`.
        *   **Denominator (Theoretical Volume):** Checks for `item.theoretical_volume_m3`, `item.volume_blasted`, `item.blast_volume`, or `item.prodution_therotical_vol`.
*   `DarkMode` (Boolean): A flag to control the theme.

#### 3. Data Processing and Formulas (`useMemo` Hook)

The component's core logic is encapsulated within a `useMemo` hook for `processedData`. This is a critical optimization that ensures data is only re-calculated when a dependency changes.

**Step 1: Core Calculation (`calculateSpecificDrilling` function)**
This function is central to the component's logic. It computes the Specific Drilling for each record.

*   **Primary Formula:**
    ```
    Specific Drilling (m/m³) = Total Drilling Meterage (m) / Theoretical Volume Blasted (m³)
    ```
    The function intelligently selects the correct fields from the data source based on the available property names listed in the props section.

**Step 2: Data Validation**
The first step filters the raw data. A record is considered valid if the following expression is true:
```
(record.total_exp_cost > 0) AND (isValidDate(record.blastdate)) AND (calculateSpecificDrilling(record) IS NOT NULL)
```
This ensures that every record has a cost, a valid date, and the necessary data to compute a valid Specific Drilling value.

**Step 3: Time-Based Filtering**
The validated records are then filtered based on the selected `timeMode` and its corresponding date controls.

**Step 4: Data Aggregation**
The final data set is created based on the `timeMode`.

*   **If `timeMode` is 'Daily' or 'Monthly'**:
    The data is **not aggregated**. Each individual blast record is represented as a data point on the chart, using the result from the `calculateSpecificDrilling` function.

*   **If `timeMode` is 'Yearly'**:
    The data **is aggregated**. All records for a given year are grouped together to produce a single data point representing the period's average.
    *   **Formula for Average Specific Drilling (for the year):**
        ```
        Avg(Specific Drilling) = (Σ calculateSpecificDrilling(record)) / N_valid
        ```
        *(Where `N_valid` is the count of records with a valid Specific Drilling value in that year.)*

**Step 5: Trendline Calculation**
After the main data is processed, a linear regression is performed on the `specific_drilling` data to create a trendline. This involves solving for the slope (`m`) and y-intercept (`b`) of the line `y = mx + b` and adding a `trendline` property to each data point.

#### 4. Summary Statistics (`summaryStats`)

A separate `useMemo` hook calculates high-level statistics based on the `processedData`.

*   `totalCost`: Sum of `total_exp_cost`.
*   `avgSpecificDrilling`: The average of all valid calculated `specific_drilling` values.
*   `totalDrillingMeterage`: The sum of the total drilling meterage for all records.
*   `totalTheoreticalVolume`: The sum of the theoretical volume for all records.
*   `totalBlasts`: The total count of records in the current view.

#### 5. Export Functionality (`handleExport` and `handleExportSimple`)

The component includes two export functions to ensure robustness across different browser environments.

*   **Primary Method (`handleExport`):** Uses `html2canvas` to capture a high-resolution, styled image of the chart container, ideal for PNG, JPEG, and PDF.
*   **Simple/Fallback Method (`handleExportSimple`):** Provides a more direct export path. For CSV, it manually constructs the file. For image formats, it extracts the raw SVG from the chart, converts it to a canvas, and then exports it. This is a reliable fallback if `html2canvas` encounters complex CSS.
*   **Formats:** Supports PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG, and CSV. The CSV export is particularly useful as it includes the raw components of the calculation (`Drilling Meterage (m)`, `Theoretical Volume (m³)`).

#### 6. Rendering and UI (JSX)

*   **Header & Controls:** Provides the UI for changing `timeMode`, date ranges, and toggling the visibility of the Specific Drilling line.
*   **Main Chart:** The `recharts` `<LineChart>` is the centerpiece.
    *   It renders a primary line for the `specific_drilling` data.
    *   A second, dashed `<Line>` component is rendered for the calculated `trendline`.
    *   The tooltip is enhanced to show the raw values and the formula used in the Specific Drilling calculation, providing full transparency.
*   **Summary Cards:** Four cards display the key calculated statistics, including the new totals for drilling meterage and theoretical volume.
