### Deep Explanation of the `SpecificCharge` Analytics Component

This document provides an in-depth analysis of the `SpecificCharge` component, a specialized dashboard for visualizing and analyzing the specific charge (also known as powder factor) from mining blast operations. The component now features a robust calculation engine that computes this value from fundamental data fields.

#### 1. Core Purpose and Functionality

The `SpecificCharge` dashboard is an analytics tool designed to monitor a critical blast efficiency metric: **Specific Charge**, which is the mass of explosives used per unit volume of rock (kg/m³). It renders this data on an interactive line chart and includes a calculated **trendline**, allowing users to assess performance and identify trends over various time scales.

**Key Features:**
*   **Dynamic Calculation:** The component's primary feature is its ability to calculate Specific Charge on-the-fly using a core formula, rather than relying on a pre-calculated field.
*   **Interactive Line Chart:** Uses the `recharts` library to display Specific Charge trends over time.
*   **Trendline Analysis:** Automatically calculates and displays a linear regression trendline for the Specific Charge data, helping to visualize the overall performance trajectory.
*   **Advanced Time Filtering:** Users can switch between "Daily," "Monthly," and "Yearly" views, with context-aware controls for filtering the data.
*   **Intelligent UI:** The month selection dropdown dynamically updates to disable months that have no data for the selected year, improving user experience.
*   **Statistical Summaries:** Displays key statistics (average specific charge, total explosive used, total volume blasted, total blasts, and total cost) in clear, concise summary cards.
*   **Robust Export Engine:** A powerful export feature allows users to download the chart and its underlying data in multiple formats (PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG, CSV).

#### 2. Component Architecture and Props

The component is a functional React component built with Hooks (`useState`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `useEffect`).

**Props:**
*   `filteredData` (Array): The primary data source. It's an array of objects, where each object represents a single blast event. The component expects the following **real field names** for its calculations:
    *   `blastdate` (String): The date of the blast in "DD-MM-YYYY" format.
    *   `total_exp_cost` (Number): The total cost of the blast.
    *   **For Specific Charge Calculation (Primary):**
        *   `total_explosive_kg` (or fallbacks: `explosive_quantity`, `explosive_used`)
        *   `theoretical_volume_m3` (or fallbacks: `volume_blasted`, `blast_volume`)
    *   **For Specific Charge Calculation (Fallback):**
        *   `actual_pf_ton_kg` (Used if the primary fields are not available).
*   `DarkMode` (Boolean): A flag to control the theme.

#### 3. Data Processing and Formulas (`useMemo` Hook)

The component's core logic is encapsulated within a `useMemo` hook for `processedData`. This is a critical optimization that ensures data is only re-calculated when a dependency changes.

**Step 1: Core Calculation (`calculateSpecificCharge` function)**
This function is central to the component's logic. It computes the Specific Charge for each record.

*   **Primary Formula:**
    ```
    Specific Charge (kg/m³) = Total Explosive (kg) / Theoretical Volume Blasted (m³)
    ```
    Where:
    *   `Total Explosive (kg)` is derived from `item.total_explosive_kg`, `item.explosive_quantity`, or `item.explosive_used`.
    *   `Theoretical Volume Blasted (m³)` is derived from `item.theoretical_volume_m3`, `item.volume_blasted`, or `item.blast_volume`.

*   **Fallback Logic:**
    If the fields required for the primary formula are not available or are zero, the function falls back to using the pre-existing `item.actual_pf_ton_kg` field.

**Step 2: Data Validation**
The first step filters the raw data. A record is considered valid if the following expression is true:
```
(record.total_exp_cost > 0) AND (isValidDate(record.blastdate)) AND (calculateSpecificCharge(record) > 0)
```
This ensures that every record has a cost, a valid date, and a valid, non-zero Specific Charge measurement.

**Step 3: Time-Based Filtering**
The validated records are then filtered based on the selected `timeMode` and its corresponding date controls.

**Step 4: Data Aggregation**
The final data set is created based on the `timeMode`.

*   **If `timeMode` is 'Daily'**:
    The data is **not aggregated**. Each individual blast record is represented as a data point on the chart, using the result from the `calculateSpecificCharge` function.

*   **If `timeMode` is 'Monthly' or 'Yearly'**:
    The data **is aggregated**. All records for a given period are grouped together to produce a single data point representing the period's average.
    *   **Formula for Average Specific Charge (for the period):**
        ```
        Avg(Specific Charge) = (Σ calculateSpecificCharge(record)) / N_valid
        ```
        *(Where `N_valid` is the count of records with a valid Specific Charge value in that period.)*

**Step 5: Trendline Calculation**
After the main data is processed, a linear regression is performed on the `actual_pf_ton_kg` (calculated specific charge) data to create a trendline. This involves solving for the slope (`m`) and y-intercept (`b`) of the line `y = mx + b` and adding a `trendline` property to each data point.

#### 4. Summary Statistics (`summaryStats`)

A separate `useMemo` hook calculates high-level statistics based on the `processedData`.

*   `totalCost`: Sum of `total_exp_cost`.
*   `avgSpecificCharge`: The average of all valid calculated `actual_pf_ton_kg` values.
*   `totalBlasts`: The total count of records in the current view.
*   `totalExplosive`: The sum of `total_explosive_kg` (or its fallbacks).
*   `totalVolume`: The sum of `theoretical_volume_m3` (or its fallbacks).

#### 5. Export Functionality (`handleExport`)

The component includes a robust export function with fallbacks.

*   **Primary Method:** Uses `html2canvas` to capture a high-resolution, styled image of the chart container, ideal for PNG, JPEG, and PDF.
*   **Fallback Method:** If `html2canvas` fails, it extracts the raw SVG from the chart, converts it to a canvas, and then exports it.
*   **Formats:** Supports PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG, and CSV. The CSV export is particularly useful as it includes the raw components of the calculation (`Total Explosive (kg)`, `Volume Blasted (m³)`).

#### 6. Rendering and UI (JSX)

*   **Header & Controls:** Provides the UI for changing `timeMode`, date ranges, and toggling the visibility of the Specific Charge line. The month dropdown intelligently disables options where no data exists for the selected year.
*   **Main Chart:** The `recharts` `<LineChart>` is the centerpiece.
    *   It renders a primary line for the `actual_pf_ton_kg` data.
    *   A second, dashed `<Line>` component is rendered for the calculated `trendline`.
    *   The tooltip is enhanced to show the raw values used in the Specific Charge calculation, providing full transparency.
*   **Summary Cards:** Four cards display the key calculated statistics, including the new totals for explosive and volume.
