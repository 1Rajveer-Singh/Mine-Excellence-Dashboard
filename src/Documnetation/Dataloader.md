# DataFilter Component – Technical and Functional Report

---

## 1. Overview

The `DataFilter` React component offers an advanced, user-friendly interface for filtering, viewing, and exporting mining-related geological data. It is designed as a smart filter panel for mining analytics dashboards, providing deep control over hierarchical filters (Mine, Pit, Zone, Bench, Rock), data upload, and seamless integration with downstream analytical components (e.g., KPI3/Flyrock).

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 Dynamic & Hierarchical Filtering

- **Filter Hierarchy**: Filters cascade in dependency—selecting a mine enables pit selection, which enables zone, then bench, then rock type.
- **Fields Supported**:
  - `minename`
  - `pitname`
  - `zonename`
  - `benchname`
  - `rock_name`
- **Active Filter Count**: Visibly tracks how many filters are set.
- **Intelligent Options**: Each dropdown only shows valid options based on previous selections, avoiding dead-ends and user error.

### 2.2 Data Loading & Fallback

- **API Integration**: Fetches records from a local JSON API (`CleanRecords_api.json`) by default.
- **CSV Upload Fallback**: (Hidden) CSV upload mode can be enabled with a keyboard shortcut (Alt+R+K), supporting custom user data.
- **Robust Data Handling**: If API fails, loads mock data for uninterrupted demo/user experience.

### 2.3 State Management

- **Loading State**: Animated, branded loading screen while data loads.
- **Theme State**: Supports light and dark modes, toggled by user.
- **Compact Mode**: Toggle for condensed filter panel layout.
- **Panel Collapse**: Expand/collapse filter panel for focus or space.
- **View Mode**: Grid/List toggle for filter arrangement.

### 2.4 Data Export

- **CSV Export**: One-click export of the currently filtered dataset as a CSV file, with headers and correct encoding.

### 2.5 Statistics & UX

- **Live Statistics**: Shows filtered vs. total record count, with percent filtered, and live data indicator.
- **Smart UI**: Responsive layout, gradient backgrounds, animated highlights, and modern, semantic UI elements.
- **Accessibility**: All controls are keyboard-accessible and clearly labeled.

### 2.6 Integration

- **Downstream Analytics**: Passes the filtered data and theme mode to child analytical components (like `KPI3`/`Flyrock`) for further visualization and metrics.

## 3. Data Processing & Logic

### 3.1 Data Fetch and Fallback

- First attempts to load from `CleanRecords_api.json` (assumed API structure: `{ data: [...] }`).
- If unavailable, uses mock fallback data.

### 3.2 CSV Upload

- Parses CSV file, lowercases headers, and maps rows to objects.
- If parsing fails, alerts the user with an error message.

### 3.3 Filter Options Computation

- Computes unique, valid options for each filter based on current selections, ensuring only relevant values are shown at each level.

### 3.4 Filtering

- Applies all active filters to the data, returning only records matching every selection.
- Resets lower-level filters when a higher-level filter changes.

## 4. User Experience

- **Animated, Modern Design**: Gradient backgrounds, pulsing highlights, and blur effects create a visually engaging experience.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Loading indicators, live stats, and filter counts keep users informed.
- **Simple CSV Upload**: Enables custom data analysis for power users (hidden behind keyboard shortcut).
- **One-Click Export**: Makes reporting and sharing filtered data effortless.

## 5. Example Workflow

1. **User lands on dashboard** → sees loading animation.
2. **Data loads** → smart filters are available.
3. **User selects "Mine A"** → only relevant pits appear.
4. **User continues down filter chain** → options get narrower, ensuring a valid filter path.
5. **User sees how many records match** → can export as CSV.
6. **User enables compact mode or switches theme** as needed.
7. **User passes data to analytics components** (like KPI3/Flyrock) for further insights.

---

## 6. Strengths

- **Highly Usable**: Intuitive, logical filtering with no dead-ends.
- **Robust**: Handles API failure, custom data, and state resets gracefully.
- **Modern UI**: Appeals to both technical and non-technical users.
- **Extensible**: Designed for integration with more advanced analytics modules.

---

## 7. Recommendations for Enhancement

- **Add More Filter Fields**: (e.g., date, project, supervisor)
- **Save/Load Filter Presets**: For recurring analysis workflows.
- **Backend Search/Filtering**: For very large datasets.
- **Multi-Select Filtering**: Allow selection of multiple values per filter.
- **Error/Success Toasts**: For actions like CSV upload/export.

## 8. Conclusion

The `DataFilter` component is a robust, extensible, and user-centric smart filter panel for mining analytics. It seamlessly handles data loading, fallback, user input, and export, serving as a critical entry point for high-value downstream analysis and decision support in mining operations.
